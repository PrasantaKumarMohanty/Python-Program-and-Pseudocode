Question - 4 : Write a program that calculates the count of words and spaces present in the file.

Pseudocode:

Make a function def counter(one argument):
	Initialize the variable num_words = 0
	Initialize the variable num_charc = 0
	Initialize the variable num_spaces = 0
	
	Make a list and store all the special character ch = ["*", "@", "#", "$", "%", "&", ".", "?", ",", "<", ">", ";", ":", "/", "|", "[", "]", "{", "}", "=", "+", "_",
          "-", "(", ")", "^", "!", "`", "~"]

	with open(fname, 'r') as f:
		Perform a loop for all the line present in f:
			Concatenate the string split_var = line.split(' ')
			Convert all the string presents in list to lower case low_list = [each_string.lower() for each_string in split_var]
			Convert the list to set
			Perform if-else statement if (len of list != len of set):
				num_dup= (len(low_list) - len(set_list)) + 1
			else:
				num_dup =0

			word = "Y"
			
			Perform a loop for all the letter present in line:
				if (letter != ' ' and word == 'Y'):
					Initialize the variable num_words and increment by 1
					 word = 'N'
				elif (letter == ' '):
					Initialize the variable num_spaces and increment by 1
				word = 'Y'
				Perform a loop for i in letter:
					if i in ch:
						Initialize the variable num_charc and increment by 1
		print num_words for count the all words
            	print num_dup for count the all duplicate words
            	print num_charc for count the all special character
            	print num_spaces for count the all spaces

if __name__ == '__main__':
	Retrieve the path of the file from the user into variable fname
	Perform a try block to handles the exceptions:
        	counter(fname)
    	except:
        	print File not found
